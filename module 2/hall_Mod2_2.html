        <!-- Paragraphs with personal introduction -->
        <p class="intro">I have always enjoyed using computers. As a kid, I taught myself how to mod the sims. Nowadays, I spend a lot of my free time modding skyrim, from making patches to troubleshooting and fixing glitches, I enjoy it all.</p>
        
        <p>As a kid, I was always curious about how things worked. Whether it was dismantling gadgets or experimenting with DIY projects, my inquisitive nature led me to develop a passion for learning. This curiosity has stayed with me throughout my life and continues to drive me in my professional and personal pursuits. <span class="sentence">My love for technology began during these early years.</span></p>
        
        <p>In my spare time, I enjoy a variety of other hobbies too, from horror movies and books to coding and gaming. Each hobby allows me to express different facets of my personality and keeps me balanced. Whether I’m trying to predict the ending to a new horror movie or solving complex coding problems, I find joy in the process and the results.</p>
        
        <p>Family is a significant part of my life. I come from a close-knit family that has always supported me in my endeavors. Their encouragement has been a constant source of motivation, and I am grateful for the strong bond we share. This sense of family extends to my friends, who I consider my second family.</p>
