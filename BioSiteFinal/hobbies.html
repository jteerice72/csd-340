                <h2>Bird Watching</h2>
                <p>Olivia Desjardins' interest in bird watching began as a hobby that a friend introduced her to, but it quickly developed into a full-fledged love. Even what began as a few aimless park walks quickly developed into a serious hobby. Olivia discovered that she was drawn to the happiness and peace that bird watching provided. Every time a bird was sighted, it was like solving a new mystery about nature.</p>

                <p>As she gained more knowledge about different species, their habits, and their environments, her curiosity increased. She began recording her observations by making thorough notes and taking pictures to show off the individuality and beauty of each bird. Olivia increased her expertise and made new friends by attending courses, joining local bird watching clubs and online groups.</p>
                
                <h2>Medieval Art History</h2>
                <p>Olivia Desjardins has had an interesting academic career. Because of her intense interest in the past, she majored in history when she first enrolled in college. She did exceptionally well in her coursework, which soon made her enthusiasm for piecing together the history of many eras clear. But Olivia developed an especially strong interest in medieval art history while she was studying.</p>
                
                <p>She changed her field of study after realizing how much she loved studying medieval works of art. Olivia was able to merge her passion for art with her love of history when she decided to specialize in medieval art history. </p>
